''' In Python, we use the input() function to take input and assign the input to a variable. In Python, a variable name is not preceded by its data-type, instead we just 
use the variable name and python changes its data-type according to the input type.
Example:

Input:
a = Geeks
b = For
c = Geeks
Output:  Geeks For Geeks  '''

def inPutCat():
    a = input()
    b = input()
    c = input()
    print(a, b, c)
