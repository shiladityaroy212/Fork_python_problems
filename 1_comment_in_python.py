''' You have learnt about input and output in Python. One of the pivotal thing in the world of programming is comment which is used by developers to describe their code 
or to preclude compiler from compiling the line(s) which they don't want to. In this section, we will learn how to comment any line in Python.

Hint:
# -> is used to comment a single line.
''' ''' -> is used to comment multiple lines.

Example:
Output: Geeks For Geeks  '''

def print_func():
   # print ("Geeks Classes")
    print ("Geeks For Geeks")
    #print ("Geeks Quiz")
    #print ("Geeks")
    #print ("Geeks For")
